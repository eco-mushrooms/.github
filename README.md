# Smart Mushroom Farming Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Mushroom Farming project! This project leverages IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies to enhance the efficiency, yield, and sustainability of mushroom farming. By integrating sensors and automated control systems, we aim to optimize the growing conditions for mushrooms, making farming more consistent and less labor-intensive.

## Project Motivation

Traditional mushroom farming faces several challenges, including inconsistent yields, inefficient resource use, and the need for continuous manual monitoring. These issues are particularly significant in regions like Kenya, where climatic conditions and resource limitations can impact farming negatively. Our project addresses these challenges by implementing a smart farming system that monitors and adjusts environmental conditions in real-time.

## Architecture Overview

Our solution consists of the following key components:
- **Sensors and Actuators**:
  - Temperature-Humidity Sensors
  - Soil Moisture Sensors
  - CO2 Sensors
  - Light Sensors
- **Control System**:
  - Esp32 Dev Kit
  - Automated Misters and Fans
- **Data Analytics Platform**:
  - Cloud Integration for real-time monitoring
  - AI and Machine Learning algorithms for data analysis

## Implementation Details

### Hardware Setup
- **Sensors**: Integrated two soil moisture sensors, two temperature-humidity sensors, a TEMT6000 light sensor, and an MH-Z14A CO2 sensor with the Arduino Nano Esp32.
- **Connectivity**: The Arduino was programmed to send sensor data to a cloud server via Wi-Fi.
- **Actuators**: Automated systems were set up to adjust humidity and ventilation based on sensor readings.

### Software Development
- **Arduino Programming**: The Arduino collects data from sensors and transmits it to the cloud.
- **Cloud Platform**: Developed a dashboard to visualize real-time and historical data.
- **AI Algorithms**: Trained machine learning models to predict optimal conditions and detect anomalies.

## Evaluation

Our implementation will be evaluated through experiments that demonstrated:
- **Environmental Consistency**: IoT system maintained optimal conditions 95% of the time.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced water usage by 20%.
- **Yield Improvement**: Produced 15% higher yields with better consistency.

## Results and Conclusions

The integration of IoT and AI in mushroom farming significantly improves environmental consistency, resource efficiency, and yield quality. While initial setup costs and technical skills are barriers, the benefits of smart farming systems are substantial. Future work will focus on refining AI algorithms and expanding the system to other types of mushroom farming.
